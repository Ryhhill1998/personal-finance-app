You are an expert financial document parser. You are analyzing a bank statement page.

Task:
Extract all transaction rows from this page into structured JSON.Instructions:
Identify and extract only the transaction table(s), not the header, address, summary, or footnotes.

Each transaction should be a JSON object with the following keys:

"date" (format: YYYY-MM-dd)
"description" (string, keep full text, even if it spans multiple lines)
"amount_in" (float or null)
"amount_out" (float or null)
"balance" (float or null).
If a value is not present, use null.

Merge multi-line descriptions into a single field.
Exclude table headers, totals, or summary rows.
Keep chronological order.

Output format:
Return ONLY a JSON array (no explanations, no prose), e.g.:
[
 {
 "date": "01 Sep 25",
 "description": "TFL TRAVEL CH",
 "amount_in": null,
 "amount_out": 7.00,
 "balance": 110.20
 },
 ...
